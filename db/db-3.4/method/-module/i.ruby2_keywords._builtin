--- ruby2_keywords(method_name, ...)    -> nil

For the given method names, marks the method as passing keywords through
a normal argument splat.  This should only be called on methods that
accept an argument splat (`*args`) but not explicit keywords or a
keyword splat.  It marks the method such that if the method is called
with keyword arguments, the final hash argument is marked with a special
flag such that if it is the final element of a normal argument splat to
another method call, and that method call does not include explicit
keywords or a keyword splat, the final element is interpreted as
keywords. In other words, keywords will be passed through the method to
other methods.

This should only be used for methods that delegate keywords to another
method, and only for backwards compatibility with Ruby versions before
2.7.

This method will probably be removed at some point, as it exists only
for backwards compatibility. As it does not exist in Ruby versions
before 2.7, check that the module responds to this method before calling
it. Also, be aware that if this method is removed, the behavior of the
method will change so that it does not pass through keywords.
